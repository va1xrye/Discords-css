# Discord's CSS 
 
All of the CSS used in the making of Discord.
Edit this code and customize it however you like!
This version should be bugless, but some can still occur! If so, please issue it to me on discord at valxrye#0438.

# Notes
 Currently working on explaining the code via comments so users can understand what every line of code does and working on the release of the Discord's HTML.
# Have fun!
